 <s2 title='XNI Parser Configuration'>
  <p>
   An XML application programmer can use the Xerces Native Interface
   parser configuration interfaces to build different parser 
   configurations, either completely from scratch or by mixing
   and matching existing parser components. For advanced users
   that want to take advantage of this capability, an understanding
   of the parser configuration framework is required.
